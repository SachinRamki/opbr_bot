The OPBR Window Manager is a collection of Python functions that provide various window and image-related utilities, including capturing screenshots of specific windows, listing all open windows, and displaying images.

## Functions

### `view_image(image, title="single image")`

Display a single image with the given title using Matplotlib.

**Parameters:**
- `image` (PIL Image or ndarray): The image to display.
- `title` (str, optional): The title for the displayed image. Defaults to "single image".

### `view_images(image_list, title="multiple images")`

Display a list of images in a grid with the given title using Matplotlib.

**Parameters:**
- `image_list` (List[PIL Image or ndarray]): The list of images to display.
- `title` (str, optional): The title for the displayed images. Defaults to "multiple images".

### `get_titlebar_height()`

Get the height of the window title bar on Linux.

**Returns:**
- The height of the title bar (int).

### `all_window_info()`

Get information about all open windows, including their names, IDs, positions, and dimensions.

**Returns:**
- A list of window information, where each entry is a list with the following elements:
  - `window_name` (str): The name of the window.
  - `window_id` (str): The ID of the window.
  - `x_cord` (int): The X-coordinate of the window.
  - `y_cord` (int): The Y-coordinate of the window.
  - `width` (int): The width of the window.
  - `height` (int): The height of the window.

### `specific_window_info(window_name="V2105")`

Get information about a specific window with the given name.

**Parameters:**
- `window_name` (str, optional): The name of the specific window to query. Defaults to "V2105".

**Returns:**
- A dictionary containing the following information:
  - `window_id` (str): The ID of the window.
  - `x` (int): The X-coordinate of the window.
  - `y` (int): The Y-coordinate of the window.
  - `width` (int): The width of the window.
  - `height` (int): The height of the window.

### `read_images_in_folder(folder_path)`

Read images from a folder and return them as a list.

**Parameters:**
- `folder_path` (str): The path to the folder containing images.

**Returns:**
- A list of images, each represented as an ndarray.

### `pyautogui_click(x, y, frame)`

Perform a PyAutoGUI click at the specified coordinates (x, y).

**Parameters:**
- `x` (int): The X-coordinate of the click.
- `y` (int): The Y-coordinate of the click.
- `frame` (int): The frame to click.

### `screenshot_pygui(screen_name, screenshot_path)`

Capture a screenshot of a specific window using PyAutoGUI and save it to the specified path.

**Parameters:**
- `screen_name` (str): The name of the window to capture.
- `screenshot_path` (str): The path to save the screenshot.

**Returns:**
- The captured screenshot as an ndarray.

## Dependencies

The script has the following dependencies:

- `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) for image-related operations.
- `subprocess` for running shell commands.
- `os` for working with the operating system.
- `cv2` (OpenCV) for image processing.
- `numpy` for numerical and array operations.
- `time` for time-related operations.
- `pyautogui` for automating mouse and keyboard inputs.
- `threading` for managing threads.
- `matplotlib` for displaying images.

## Usage

The functions in this script can be used for various purposes, such as capturing specific window screenshots, displaying images, or obtaining information about open windows.

For example, `screenshot_pygui(screen_name, screenshot_path)` captures a screenshot of a specific window and saves it to the specified path.

```python
screenshot_pygui("V2105", "screenshot.png")
```

The captured screenshot can be further processed or displayed using the provided utility functions.
