# scrcpy Manager

The scrcpy Manager is a Python script that manages the scrcpy application, which is used for screen mirroring and controlling Android devices from a computer. This script provides functions to start and monitor the scrcpy process and handle resolution checks.

## Functions

### `get_screen_resolution()`

Get the screen resolution of the scrcpy window.

**Returns:**
A tuple containing the width and height of the screen resolution.

### `check_resolution()`

Check if the screen resolution meets the requirements.

**Returns:**
- `True` if the resolution meets the requirements.
- `False` otherwise.

### `start_scrcpy()`

Start the scrcpy process and handle resolution checks. If the resolution doesn't meet the requirements, it restarts scrcpy.

**Returns:**
- None

### `is_scrcpy_active()`

Check if scrcpy is currently active.

**Returns:**
- `True` if scrcpy is active.
- `False` otherwise.

## Usage

The script is designed to be executed as the main program. When you run the script, it will start the scrcpy process and continuously monitor it. If the resolution doesn't meet the requirements, it will restart scrcpy.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_scrcpy()
```

## Dependencies

The script has the following dependencies:

- `subprocess` for running shell commands.
- `time` for time-related operations.
- `psutil` for retrieving information on running processes.
- `opbr_keyboard_listener` (imported function `close_scrcpy_window`) for closing the scrcpy window if the resolution doesn't meet the requirements.

You can install `psutil` using pip:

```bash
pip install psutil
```

## Resolution Requirements

The script checks if the screen resolution of the scrcpy window meets the following requirements:

- The width (`w`) must be either 1024 (landscape) or 352 (portrait).

If the resolution doesn't meet these requirements, the script will restart the scrcpy process.

## Monitoring

The script will continuously monitor the scrcpy process and check for resolution requirements. If you wish to exit the script, you can use Ctrl+C, which will terminate the scrcpy process and the script.
