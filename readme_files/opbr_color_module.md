## Documentation for `opbr_color_module.py`

### Overview

The `opbr_color_module.py` module provides a set of color codes that can be used for text output in the terminal. It also includes a function called `print_colored` that allows you to print text in the specified color. This module simplifies the process of adding colored text to your terminal-based applications.

### Color Codes

The module defines several color codes that can be used to change the color of text output in the terminal. These color codes are ANSI escape codes that are compatible with most terminal emulators. The color codes available in the module are:

- `RED`: Red text
- `GREEN`: Green text
- `YELLOW`: Yellow text
- `BLUE`: Blue text
- `MAGENTA`: Magenta text
- `LIGHTGRAY`: Light gray text
- `WHITE`: White text
- `PINK`: Pink text (may vary depending on the terminal)
- `ORANGE`: Orange text (may vary depending on the terminal)
- `VIOLET`: Violet text (may vary depending on the terminal)
- `GOLD`: Gold text (may vary depending on the terminal)
- `LAVENDER`: Lavender text (may vary depending on the terminal)
- `TEAL`: Teal text (may vary depending on the terminal)

### Function: `print_colored(text, color)`

The `print_colored` function is provided to print colored text to the terminal. It takes two parameters:

- `text` (str): The text to be printed in the specified color.
- `color` (str): The color code (defined in the module) to apply to the text.

**Example:**
```python
print_colored("This is red text.", RED)
```

### Usage

To use this module, follow these steps:

1. Import the module in your Python script.

2. Use the color codes to change the color of text using the `print_colored` function.

**Example Usage:**
```python
from opbr_color_module import RED, GREEN, print_colored

print_colored("This is red text.", RED)
```


### Note

The color codes provided in this module are ANSI escape codes and may work differently or have varying effects in different terminal emulators. It's advisable to test and adjust the colors as needed to achieve the desired results in your specific terminal environment.
