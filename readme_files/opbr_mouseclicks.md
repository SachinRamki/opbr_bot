# OPBR Mouse Clicks

This Python script is part of an automation system and contains functions for extracting information from YOLOv5 detection results and performing automated clicks based on detected class IDs. It's designed to automate interactions with a game or application. 

## Functions

### `get_result_info(results, view=False)`

Extracts information from YOLOv5 detection results.

- `results` (List): List of detection results.
- `view` (bool, optional): Whether to display the detection image. Defaults to False.

Returns:
- Class ID of the detected object (int).
- X-coordinate of the detected object (int).
- Y-coordinate of the detected object (int).
- List of class names (list).

### `check_cache(counter, class_cache_buffer)`

Checks the cache for consistent detection issues.

- `counter` (int): The current processing counter.
- `class_cache_buffer` (list): List of detected class IDs.

Returns:
- Updated `class_cache_buffer` (list).

### `handle_next_button()`

Handles the 'next' button action.

### `automate_clicks(c_id, mx, my, classes, class_cache_buffer, flag=True)`

Performs automated clicks based on detected class IDs.

- `c_id` (int): Class ID of the detected object.
- `mx` (int): X-coordinate of the detected object.
- `my` (int): Y-coordinate of the detected object.
- `classes` (list): List of class names.
- `class_cache_buffer` (list): List of detected class IDs.
- `flag` (bool, optional): Flag for bot operation. Defaults to True.

Returns:
- Updated `class_cache_buffer` (list).
- Updated `flag` (bool).

### `register_account()`

Registers a game account. This function performs actions to register an account and save the account details in a file.
